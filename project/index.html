WSP Week 1 Project Analysis - Fat Wreck Chords

Prospective Client - Fat Wreck Chords

Proposal Type - Complete site overhaul

Designer - Shane Trimble/Team Trimble Designs

Summary of Proposal

Fat Wreck Chords (from here on referred to as FWC) seems to be a niche site that tracks
punk bands. While not normally a punk fan, I am a fan of music and this site definitely
serves a niche purpose. Given that this is the case, we should do our best to make sure
that it is the best that it can be. I see several areas where the site can be improved.

Areas needing most improvement:

Code on the source html file is in transitional XHTML, this needs to be brought up to
modern HTML5/CSS3 spec. I saw old IE (5!) and Netscape support, clearly showing in my
opinion that updates may have been applied sporadically at best.

CSS shows that page links for bands are numerical rather than listing the name of the band that it
links to. I imagine that they are losing points here in search rankings although it's such a niche
site that SEO may not be a factor.

The navigation scheme could be collapsed a bit. Grouping similar pages (MP3, video, and pics)
under a single Media heading would simplify the navigation experience. While crawling the pages in the nav bar,
I found a dead link on the media button leading to a # URL. This is common as a placeholder and
should not have passed any sort of coding QC by a person, although it will validate.

Heavy Javascript usage could slow down load times for people on low speed connections,
although it appears to have a reasonable load time of under 1s.

Page has multiple incongrous colors and fonts. While this might be an attempt at obtaining
a "punk" feel, I think this could be accomplished in other ways. Backgrounds of text are a stark white against multiple colors, or colors on black.
I think that a color palette change could keep the feel punk while looking better on modern display devices.

The site uses a centered template which indicates at the time of the design at least 1024 
monitors may have been considered.

Competitors to Fat Wreck Chords:

DYING SCENE RECORDS (dyingscene.com) 
Epitaph Records (http://www.epitaph.com/)

I feel that all the sites share a common theme in the punk rock area of the Internet. Punk
is a unique subculture in the music scene not too often concerned with mainstream success.
I am not too surprised to see a lack of data on the sites for this reason. Lots of punk fans
would be upset if punk bands "sold out" by getting famous on major labels. Grassroots marketing
makes up a lot of punk band circulation although Internet presence is changing many things
for this outreach style.

A lot of metrics look similar especially to Epitaph, which to my horror took almost 6 seconds to load on my 50M/10M connection.

The target audience is correct at the 18 to 35 male average, most of the punk fans I know will fit this.
In future years I think that the base will age and we will see an appropriate shift in the stats for age.
Punk fans either wither with age, or remain steadfast in the quest for pure punk music. I don't imagine that many professionals are looking at punk music pages,
due either to age or interest in music. 

Target Audience:

I can imagine two average users of FWC web site. Let's take a look:

Jim "Steel Toe" Mclean

Jim is a starving artist in the Bay Area of California who idolizes NoFX, his favorite punk
band. He uses the site to keep up to date on the latest trends and shows in the local punk scene.
Based on this, he simply scans the site for the latest info before heading to myspace, Facebook, or other sites tied to FWC.
Because of this he missed the Mailing list link located way at the bottom and has to check the site more.

Eric Jones

Eric books shows for a small dive bar in San Francisco, and is always looking for the latest in up and coming punk bands to keep
ticket sales up. He scans Epitaph and Dying Scene also, because he's not looking to support any single label. Again the mailing list would 
have made information more accessible. Eric spends a lot of time on FWC navigating from page to page, as the information isn't always 
in the logical place. The site feels punk, but definitely less polished than other sites in his opinion.
